# Configuring git on windows

### git clone
`Here we'll examine the git clone command in depth. git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use cases of git clone. Some points we'll cover here are:`

- `Cloning a local or remote repository`
- `Cloning a bare repository`
- `Using shallow options to partially clone repositories`
- `Git URL syntax and supported protocols`
- `On the setting up a repository guide, we covered a basic use case of git clone. This page will explore more complex cloning and configuration scenarios.`

### Purpose: repo-to-repo collaboration development copy

`If a project has already been set up in a central repository, the git clone command is the most common way for users to obtain a development copy. Like git init, cloning is generally a one-time operation. Once a developer has obtained a working copy, all version control operations and collaborations are managed through their local repository.`
