# Git Merge Strategy Options and Examples

`When a piece of work is complete, tested and ready to be merged back into the main line of development, your team has some policy choices to make. What are your merge strategy options? In this article we'll examine the possibilities and then provide some notes on how Atlassian operates. Hopefully at the end you'll have the tools to decide what works best for your team.`

### Git Merge Strategies

`A merge happens when combining two branches. Git will take two (or more) commit pointers and attempt to find a common base commit between them. Git has several different methods to find a base commit, these methods are called "merge strategies". Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of the specified merge commits. Technically, a merge commit is a regular commit which just happens to have two parent commits.`
