# Git Merge
 
 `Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.`

`Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch. The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected. Again, this means that git merge is often used in conjunction with git checkout for selecting the current branch and git branch -d for deleting the obsolete target branch.`

### How it works

`Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches. The following examples in this document will focus on this branch merging pattern. In these scenarios, git merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them. Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.`

`Say we have a new branch feature that is based off the master branch. We now want to merge this feature branch into master.`

`Invoking this command will merge the specified branch feature into the current branch, we'll assume master. Git will determine the merge algorithm automatically (discussed below).`

`Merge commits are unique against other commits in the fact that they have two parent commits. When creating a merge commit Git will attempt to auto magically merge the separate histories for you. If Git encounters a piece of data that is changed in both histories it will be unable to automatically combine them. This scenario is a version control conflict and Git will need user intervention to continue. `

### Preparing to merge

`Before performing a merge there are a couple of preparation steps to take to ensure the merge goes smoothly.`

### Confirm the receiving branch

`Execute git status to ensure that HEAD is pointing to the correct merge-receiving branch. If needed, execute git checkout <receiving> to switch to the receiving branch. In our case we will execute git checkout master.`

### Fetch latest remote commits

`Make sure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes. Execute git fetch to pull the latest remote commits. Once the fetch is completed ensure the master branch has the latest updates by executing git pull.`

### Merging

`Once the previously discussed "preparing to merge" steps have been taken a merge can be initiated by executing git merge <branch name> where <branch name> is the name of the branch that will be merged into the receiving branch.`

### Fast Forward Merge

`A fast-forward merge can occur when there is a linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch. Instead of “actually” merging the branches, all Git has to do to integrate the histories is move (i.e., “fast forward”) the current branch tip up to the target branch tip. This effectively combines the histories, since all of the commits reachable from the target branch are now available through the current one. For example, a fast forward merge of some-feature into master would look something like the following:`
