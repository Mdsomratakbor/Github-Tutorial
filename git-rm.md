# Git RM

### Why use git rm command in git?
`A common question when getting started with Git is "How do I tell Git not to track a file (or files) any more?" The git rm command is used to remove files from a Git repository. It can be thought of as the inverse of the git add command.`

### Git rm Overview
`The git rm command can be used to remove individual files or a collection of files. The primary function of git rm is to remove tracked files from the Git index. Additionally, git rm can be used to remove files from both the staging index and the working directory. There is no option to remove a file from only the working directory. The files being operated on must be identical to the files in the current HEAD. If there is a discrepancy between the HEAD version of a file and the staging index or working tree version, Git will block the removal. This block is a safety mechanism to prevent removal of in-progress changes.`

### Usage

**"file"…​**

`Specifies the target files to remove. The option value can be an individual file, a space delimited list of files file1 file2 file3, or a wildcard file glob (~./directory/*).`
